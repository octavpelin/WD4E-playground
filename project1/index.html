            <p>Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459. It became the capital of Romania in 1862 and it nowadays stands as the most populated city in Romania, with 1.74 million inhabitants. It has a rich architecture, with mixes of historical (mostly Eclectic, but also Neoclassical and Art Noveau), interbellum (Bauhaus, Art Deco and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Revival_architecture">Romanian Revival Architecture</a>), socialist era and modern styles.</p>
            <aside>In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nicknames of Little Paris or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060221002454/http://museum.ici.ro/mbucur/english/micparis.htm">Paris of the East</a>.</aside>

                        <p>Known during the socialist era as "The House of the People", the Palace of the Parliament is the seat of the Parliament of Romania. It is the heaviest building in the world and is the third largest administrative building in the world. The building was designed in modernist Neoclassical architecture forms and style, with socialist realism in mind.</p>

                        <aside>Due to its impressive characteristics, events organized by state institutions and international bodies such as conferences and symposia take place there, but despite this about 70% of the building remains empty.</aside>

                        <p>Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the Romanian Athenaeum is the most prestigious concert hall in the Bucharest. It was opened in 1888, a building dedicated to art and science that was designed by the French architect Albert Galleron in a neoclassical style, with some romantic touches.</p>

                        <aside>On December 29, 1919, the Athenaeum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of Bessarabia, Transylvania and Bukovina historical regions with the Romanian Old Kingdom to constitute the Greater Romania</aside>

                        <summary>The Triumphal Arch</summary>
                        <p>The monument commemorates Romania's victory in the First World War, as well as the coronation of King Ferdinand I and his wife, Marie. Originally, it had a plaster exterior of elaborate sculptures and decorations designed in 1922. But the arch exterior, which has seriously decayed by 1935, was replaced in 1936 by the current, much more sober neoclassical design, more closely modelled on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</p>

                        <aside>Nowadays, The Triumphal Arch is one of the well-known symbols of the Romanian capital. Military parades are held beneath the arch each 1 December, with the occasion of Romanian National Day</aside>

                        <p>Built in 1903, this building originally belonged to a family of wealthy Greek bankers and served as their banks' headquarters for several decades in the early 20th century. Nowadays, with over ten thousand books lining the shelves, the Carturesti Carusel bookstore is considered one of the most stunning bookstores in all of Europe. Bright and airy, Carturesti Carusel's Art Nouveau style feels both ornate and simple, modern and historic. Balconies mark the upper levels of the store's six floors as Byzantine-inspired marble colonnades, archways, and spiral staircases add an undeniable sense of elegance and grandeur.</p>

                        <aside>While some have suggested the name Carturesti Carusel means “carousel of light,” it doesn't. <dfn>Carturesti</dfn> was an already existing bookstore chain that likely chose its name based on the words <dfn>carte</dfn> meaning book and <dfn>carturar</dfn> meaning learned man or scholar.</aside>

                        <p>Macca-Villacrosse Passage is an arcaded street in central Bucharest that was inaugurated in 1891 and named after the two old owners. It is known for its beautiful architecture and for the narrow fork-shaped streets covered with a semicircular roof decorated with colored glass and wrought iron. The main entrance features two allegorical statues representing Commerce and Industry. The murals, stained glass, and carved details are awe-inspiring and add a nice artistic touch to the passage.</p>

                        <aside>Today it hosts several indoor/outdoor eating establishments, including an Egyptian-themed bar/restaurant, the Blues Cafe, a bistro, a Chinese restaurant, and a wine bar. The passage is also known as King Valley, the name of the first cafe in Bucharest where hookah was smoked.</aside>

                        <p>Although the work on the building started in 1986, during the socialist regime, its construction came to an abrupt halt after the 1989 revolution. The building stood half finished until 2009, when the Romanian authorities restarted the project and completed it in 2011. The original 1986 structure, with its neoclassic and socialist style, received a completely new look with the glass shell that envelops the building in a post-modern redesign.</p>

                        <aside>A few months before his demise, in the summer of 1989, the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu insisted on inaugurating the building. Part of the main entrance hall was staged as a library, he cut the ribbon, and the year “1989” was carved on the frontispiece, where it remained for the next 20 years as a symbol of unfinished business.</aside>
